# Section 5.7: Covariance

1. (Q5.91) Let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ have the joint probability density function given below. Show that $Cov(Y_1, Y_2)=0$. Does it surprise you that $Cov(Y_1, Y_2)$ is zero? Why or why not?

$$f(y)=\begin{cases}
4y_{1}y_{2} & \begin{array}{cc}
0\le y_{1}\le1, & 0\le y_{2}\le1\end{array}\\
0 & else
\end{cases}$$

2. (Q5.93) Let the discrete random variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ have the joint probability function below. Find $Cov(Y_1, Y_2)$. Are $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ independent?

$$p(y_1, y_2) =\frac{1}{3}, (y_1, y_2) \in \{(-1,0), (0, 1), (1, 0)\}$$

3. (Q5.96) Suppose that the random variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ have means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ and variances $\sigma^2_1$ and $\sigma^2_2$. Show that:

    a) $Cov(Y_1, Y_2) = Cov(Y_2, Y_1)$
    b) $Cov(Y_1, Y_1) = \sigma^2_1$
    
4. (Q5.97) The random variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are such that $E(Y_1) = 4$, $E(Y_2) = âˆ’1$, $V(Y_1) = 2$ and $V(Y_2) = 8$.

    a) What is $Cov(Y_1 , Y_1)$?
    b) Assuming that the means and variances are correct, as given, is it possible that $Cov(Y_1,Y_2 ) = 7$? [Hint: If $Cov(Y_1 , Y_2 ) = 7$, what is the value of $\rho$ , the coefficient of correlation?]
    c) Assuming that the means and variances are correct, what is the largest possible value for $Cov(Y_1,Y_2)$? If $Cov(Y_1,Y_2)$ achieves this largest value, what does that imply about the relationship between $Y_1$ and $Y_2$?
    d) Assuming that the means and variances are correct, what is the smallest possible value for $Cov(Y_1,Y_2)$? If $Cov(Y_1,Y_2)$ achieves this smallest value, what does that imply about the relationship between $Y_1$ and $Y_2$?
    
5. (Q5.99) If $c$ is any constant and $Y$ is a random variable such that $E(Y)$ exists, show that $Cov(c, Y)=0$.

2. (Q5.105) Let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ have the joint probability density function given below. Find $V(Y_1 -Y_2)$.

$$f(y)=\begin{cases}
4y_{1}y_{2} & \begin{array}{cc}
0\le y_{1}\le1, & 0\le y_{2}\le1\end{array}\\
0 & else

    a) $1+2Y_1$ and $3+4Y_2$
    b) $1+2Y_1$ and $3-4Y_2$
    c) $1-2Y_1$ and $3-4Y_2$

4. (Q5.113) Suppose that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ have correlation coefficient $\rho_{Y_1, Y_2}$, and for constants $a, b, c, d$ define $W_1 = a+bY_1$ and $W_2 = c+dY_2$. Show that the correlation coefficient between $W_1$ and $W_2$, $\rho_{W_1, W_2}$ is such that $\vert \rho_{Y_1, Y_2} \vert = \vert \rho_{W_1, w_2} \vert$. 
    
5. (Q5.111)  A retail grocery merchant figures that her daily gain $X$ from sales is a normally distributed random variable with $\mu = 50$ and $\sigma = 3$ (measurements in dollars). $X$ can be negative if she is forced to dispose of enough perishable goods. Also, she figures daily overhead costs $Y$ to have a gamma distribution with $\alpha = 4$ and $\beta = 2$. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, find the expected value and variance of her net daily gain. Would you expect her net gain for tomorrow to rise above $70?

2. (Q5.138) Assume that $Y$ denotes the number of bacteria per cubic centimeter in a particular liquid and that $Y$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$. Further assume that $\lambda$ varies from location to location and has a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where $\alpha$ is a positive integer.
